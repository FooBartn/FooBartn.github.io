## The Voices In My Head

So I don't know about you guys, but I have these voices in my head that are at constant war with one another. 

One has been with me since I was a little kid, and it's still the big kid part of me; when I need a break, the first thing it wants to do is hang out with the family, play a video game, watch a tv show, read a book, go outside... Something to get away from "work" for a minute.

The other voice is the one that occasionally tells kid me to grow up, stop wasting my time, and go learn something. Now, I don't hate that voice. It's a big part of how I got where I am. It drives me. But part of that drive is fear. Fear that I'll get behind. Fear that people will see through the fact that I have no idea what I'm doing. It's the part of me that suffers from Imposter Syndrome.

## Hostile Takeover

In the past I've allowed both of those voices just a little too much control. 

I've had times where I felt like I'm so far behind and upside down that I spend every waking moment working or learning; trying desperately to reach some eventuality, some ephemeral, unexplainable goal, that point where I'll feel like I could matter in the tech-a-sphere community.

Perhaps, if you've shared this feeling, you know it's somewhat of a Sisyphian task. Except, instead of the boulder rolling back down, the hill just keeps getting higher. The top cannot be reached. It's a moving target. The inevitable outcome, for me at least, was a feeling of depression, helplessness, and exhaustion.

And after that the chemicals in my brain began to swing wildly in favor of the kid who just wanted to laugh and have fun. Screw doing anything that wasn't going to be an instant happy boost to my neurotransmitters. A little dopamine here, a little oxytocin there... Problem is, that kid isn't productive at all. He gets nothing done. And suddenly I start to feel very guilty and insecure.. and off we swing in the other direction.

## Balance

After being in the tech industry for over 10 years, and even switching careers, I've come to terms with the existence of these voices. They're a part of who I am.

As complex as we are, Human beings can be fairly simple at this level. We feel. Sometimes we feel a lot. Sometimes too much. We want to feel included, we want to feel like we bring something to the table, and at the same time we don't want to feel guilty for occasionally doing something for ourselves that doesn't involve our work. We need balance. When we don't have it things can get a bit rough.

Sometimes I gotta get shit done, so I tell the kid to pipe down. Other times I tell the drill sargeant with high expectations to cut me some slack so I can act like an idiot with my children or relax for some me-time without feeling guilty.

> **Disclaimer:** I don't actually hear voices. Stop looking at me that way.

Imposter Syndrome isn't ever going to go away. And I'm not really sure I want it to. I think there is power in understanding it for what it is. Allowing it to drive me, to a point.. but not letting it run my life. I know that the top of the hill can't be reached, and I'm okay with that. 

Don't misunderstand that as an excuse to stop learning, because that would be very far from the truth. I'm still pushing that boulder. I love what I do. The difference is that thinking this way gives me a chance to *enjoy* it, instead of being held hostage by it.

And I think everyone should embrace their inner child a little more often. Take a break. Be silly. Have fun. Smile. Balance the scales a little.

## Talk About It

I know it's a pretty common topic right now, but I hope that sharing my experience will bring someone a little more peace of mind about themselves. 

One of the best things you can do if you start to feel depressed or defeated is talk to someone. It's not always what we want to do. It can make us feel a bit weak to admit that we feel small.. unimportant.. stupid in the face of genius we perceive all around us. But the more you speak about it out loud, the less heavy it will feel. So find someone who will listen, who won't judge, and just talk. And if you don't have anyone, come talk to me.
